#### Why?

Learning python. General restlessness. Distracting myself from my own mind, etc.


#### Description

Script connects to an FTP server, presumably running on a phone, 
and downloads photos, videos, music, etc. 
Only downloads the new files. Before connecting, 
can search for the phone in a pool of IP's in case DHCP is used on the network.
Edit config.py to specify you info such as FTP username and password.


##### Note:
The script hasn't been tested since the latest modifications.
